00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,690
if you go incredibly fast like the speed
of light if you could travel at the

of light if you could travel at the
 

173
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,970

00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,260
you'll stay the same but everybody that
you know will die that's not really true

Einstein called it relativity because
what he meant was your aging will be

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,820
what he meant was your aging will be
different relative to people's aging on

you'll still age time will still pass
 

191
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,920
you'll still age time will still pass
for you but people on earth will age at

for you but people on earth will age at
 

193
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,020
for you but people on earth will age at
a different rate so that if you came

194
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,030
a different rate so that if you came
 

195
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,150
a different rate so that if you came
back after going incredibly fast you

196
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,160
back after going incredibly fast you
 

197
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,950
back after going incredibly fast you
would have gotten older by the amount of

198
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:40,960
would have gotten older by the amount of
 

199
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,750
would have gotten older by the amount of
time that it took for you to travel but

people on earth would have aged much
 

203
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,890
people on earth would have aged much
much faster they would have had a longer

much faster they would have had a longer
 

205
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,480
much faster they would have had a longer
period of time because even get going

fast enough your speed is sort of

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,050
fast enough your speed is sort of
 

209
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,110
fast enough your speed is sort of
proportional to the time passing so

210
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:52,120
proportional to the time passing so
 

211
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,210
proportional to the time passing so
you'll still age but you just ain't a

you'll still age but you just ain't a
 

213

experiment imagine if you were looking
 

219
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,200
experiment imagine if you were looking
at a clock that the light from the clock

220
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,210
at a clock that the light from the clock
 

221
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,120
at a clock that the light from the clock
is coming and hitting your eyeballs and

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,130
is coming and hitting your eyeballs and
 

223
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,800
is coming and hitting your eyeballs and
telling you it's 12 o'clock I'll imagine

224
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:04,810
telling you it's 12 o'clock I'll imagine
 

225
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,140
telling you it's 12 o'clock I'll imagine
if you could move away from that clock

if you could move away from that clock
 

227
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,660
if you could move away from that clock
at the speed of light it would only say

at the speed of light it would only say
 

229
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,150
at the speed of light it would only say
12 o'clock because that light and you

230
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,160
12 o'clock because that light and you
 

231
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,740
12 o'clock because that light and you
would be moving away from the clock at

would be moving away from the clock at
 

233
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,300
would be moving away from the clock at
the same speed so for you it would look

234
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:15,310
the same speed so for you it would look
 

235
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,640
the same speed so for you it would look
like it was always 12 o'clock forever

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,390
you'd still be getting older but that
clock would always look like it was the

have no way to control gravity we can

322
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:51,550
have no way to control gravity we can
 

323
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,640
have no way to control gravity we can
sort of pretend there's gravity by

sort of pretend there's gravity by
 

325
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,680
sort of pretend there's gravity by

string maybe someday we'll figure out
 

331
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,050
string maybe someday we'll figure out
how to control gravity but for now we

332
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:01,060
how to control gravity but for now we
 

333
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,820
how to control gravity but for now we
have to spin the whole ship only in the

00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:02,830
have to spin the whole ship only in the

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,240
have to spin the whole ship only in the

00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:08,229
seen that people think that NASA is

00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:10,529
seen that people think that NASA is
working on warp speed so that we can

00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:10,539
working on warp speed so that we can

00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,010
in fact so how can you generate that
much electricity and what does it do to

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,120
your mast we don't know we think maybe
it's possible that you could go faster

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,130
it's possible that you could go faster
 

367
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,529
it's possible that you could go faster
than the speed of light but we sure

368
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:40,539
than the speed of light but we sure
 

369
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:42,420
than the speed of light but we sure
don't understand how right now so we're

370
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:42,430
don't understand how right now so we're
 

371
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,760
don't understand how right now so we're
not really working on it so it's not

00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:44,770
not really working on it so it's not
 

373
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,890
not really working on it so it's not
really true we're hoping for

00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,380

in so many movies you see that the only

way that they survive interstellar
 

379

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,170
freeze yourself into cryo sleep we don't
know how to do that right now when you

00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:00,180
know how to do that right now when you
 

385
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,510
know how to do that right now when you
freeze water which is what we're mostly

386
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:02,520
freeze water which is what we're mostly
 

387
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,280

00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:28,140
permanently destroyed maybe we'll figure
 

411
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,350
permanently destroyed maybe we'll figure
it out someday but all of those movies

it out someday but all of those movies
 

413
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,840
it out someday but all of those movies
that rely on freezing the crew we don't

you're gonna be taller forever an

00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
you're gonna be taller forever an

you're gonna be taller forever an
irreversible experience and it's not

484
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:43,550
irreversible experience and it's not
 

485
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,430
irreversible experience and it's not
really true as I'm standing here talking

486

really true as I'm standing here talking

right now gravity is pushing me down

488
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:48,350
right now gravity is pushing me down
 

489
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,530
right now gravity is pushing me down
towards the floor every single bone in

490
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:50,540
towards the floor every single bone in
 

491
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,389
towards the floor every single bone in
my body and a little bit of gristle

492
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
my body and a little bit of gristle
 

493
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,490
my body and a little bit of gristle
that's in between the bones like each of

494
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:54,500
that's in between the bones like each of
 

495
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,740
that's in between the bones like each of
the vertebra of my back everyone has a

496
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:56,750
the vertebra of my back everyone has a
 

497
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,720
the vertebra of my back everyone has a
little disk in between each of the bones

498
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:58,730
little disk in between each of the bones
 

499
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,699
little disk in between each of the bones
and even my hip bones on my knee bones

500
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:00,709
and even my hip bones on my knee bones
 

501
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:02,410
and even my hip bones on my knee bones
there's a little bit of a gap well if

502
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:02,420
there's a little bit of a gap well if
 

503
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,660
there's a little bit of a gap well if
there's no gravity pushing me down and

504
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:04,670
there's no gravity pushing me down and
 

505
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,030
there's no gravity pushing me down and
those gaps can all get a tiny bit bigger

506
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,040
those gaps can all get a tiny bit bigger
 

507
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,949
those gaps can all get a tiny bit bigger
if you stay in weightlessness for a few

508
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:08,959
if you stay in weightlessness for a few
 

509
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,990
if you stay in weightlessness for a few
weeks in fact your body just sort of

510
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,000
weeks in fact your body just sort of
 

511
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,660
weeks in fact your body just sort of
stretches because the gap between each

512
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:13,670
stretches because the gap between each
 

513
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,220
stretches because the gap between each
of the bones gets a little bigger and in

514
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,230
of the bones gets a little bigger and in
 

515
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,199
of the bones gets a little bigger and in
my case I got about that much taller but

516
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:17,209
my case I got about that much taller but
 

517
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:19,000
my case I got about that much taller but
you aren't really taller you're just

518
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,010
you aren't really taller you're just
 

519
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,400
you aren't really taller you're just
sort of temporarily longer but it's not

520
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:21,410
sort of temporarily longer but it's not
 

521
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,990
sort of temporarily longer but it's not
permanent as soon as you get home and

522
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:23,000
permanent as soon as you get home and
 

523
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,150
permanent as soon as you get home and
gravity starts doing its its work on you

524
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,160
gravity starts doing its its work on you
 

525
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,100
gravity starts doing its its work on you
and grinding you down everything

526
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,110
and grinding you down everything
 

527
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,319
and grinding you down everything
squishes back down to its launch so you

528
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:29,329
squishes back down to its launch so you
 

529
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:31,090
squishes back down to its launch so you
maybe for a little while a little bit

530
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:31,100
maybe for a little while a little bit
 

531
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,040
maybe for a little while a little bit
taller in space and it may hurt your

532
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,050
taller in space and it may hurt your
 

533
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,629
taller in space and it may hurt your
back a little cuz everything's sort of

534
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:34,639
back a little cuz everything's sort of
 

535
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,490
back a little cuz everything's sort of
getting pulled tight some people have

536
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:36,500
getting pulled tight some people have
 

537
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,530
getting pulled tight some people have
back pain in space as a result but it's

538
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:38,540
back pain in space as a result but it's
 

539
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,509
back pain in space as a result but it's
not really growing it's just sort of

540
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:40,519
not really growing it's just sort of
 

541
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:42,699
not really growing it's just sort of
stretching to your natural maximum that

542
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:42,709
stretching to your natural maximum that
 

543
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,290
stretching to your natural maximum that
you're gonna get squished back again as

544
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:44,300
you're gonna get squished back again as
 

545
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,300
you're gonna get squished back again as
soon as you get home if you do get maybe

546
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,310
soon as you get home if you do get maybe
 

547
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,160
soon as you get home if you do get maybe
that much longer after you've been in

548
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,170
that much longer after you've been in
 

549
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,150
that much longer after you've been in
space for a few weeks

you put on a spacesuit who custom-fit

but we know it's going to happen so we
 

563
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,960
but we know it's going to happen so we
actually plan in advance we fit our

actually plan in advance we fit our

are gonna be a little bit taller when

are gonna be a little bit taller when

00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:06,670
are gonna be a little bit taller when
they're in space or at least their

stretched and even the seat that

stretched and even the seat that
 

575
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,860
stretched and even the seat that
protects us when we come back to earth a

crash seat so that when we hit the
 

579

there but your clothes you don't really

586
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:20,449
there but your clothes you don't really
 

587
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:21,970
there but your clothes you don't really
know how they fit because you're

588
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:21,980
know how they fit because you're
 

589
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,889
know how they fit because you're
floating around weightless your shirt is

590
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:23,899
floating around weightless your shirt is
 

591
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:26,439
floating around weightless your shirt is
always floating around your body so you

592
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:26,449
always floating around your body so you
 

593
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:28,120
always floating around your body so you
never really have a sense up there how

594
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,130
never really have a sense up there how
 

595
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,889
never really have a sense up there how
well your clothes fit just because

596
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:29,899
well your clothes fit just because
 

597
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:31,480
well your clothes fit just because
there's no gravity to pull them down and

598
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:31,490
there's no gravity to pull them down and
 

599
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,280
there's no gravity to pull them down and
look and see how well they're fitting on

600
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:33,290
look and see how well they're fitting on
 

601
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,569
look and see how well they're fitting on
your body it's more like they're just

602
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:34,579
your body it's more like they're just
 

603
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:37,180
your body it's more like they're just
floating next

604
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,190
floating next
 

605
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,249
